# uboot

This is currently latest uboot version of VoCore2.
Compare to old version uboot, it removes some functions to make it more stable.

To use it, need to setup a 32bit Linux virtual machine, then uncompress toolchain, modify uboot source code toolchain position(detail update later), also need to apply patch, then you can directly compile and upload to your VoCore2.
